                        <p><b>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. With CSS you can customize your website in any way possible. I learned CSS aside HTML so it was alot to process. Colors, fonts and size CSS can do it all. CSS uses keywords with other keywords in your main piece of code (HTML). As an example if you use div style="example" you can use the keyword 'example' to style whatever is in that div tag, could be a heading or a picture or to color something. </b></p>

We first had to make a brand new VM (Virtual Machine) and load on an administator panel which would allow us to add our computers and then this would allow us to manage the permissions. We added an Admin account to our organizational unit and setup the admin account to manage the computers we linked to our domain (Level2.lan).
