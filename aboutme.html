                <p><b>Childhood was a very calm and exciting time, where nothing could go wrong. I had everything I wanted, family,friends and being happy. Childhood was the most fun I've had in my life, meeting everyone I know today and where I am today with new friends forgetting the old. In school I was very good at maths and all the other subjects I breezed through. Nursery and Primary School was one of the best moments leading up to yr3.</b></p>
